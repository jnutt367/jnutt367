## Daily learner, daily contributer! 👨‍🎨
## I am a Software developer who got a late start in Tech way back in the year of our Lord 2 thousand and Twenty. 😅
## I have been steadily getting better and more familiar with a vast variety of technologies, coding languages and libraries and frameworks.
## I am a die-hard MJ (Michael Jordan) fan so getting in work and learning to master my craft is the mentality that I hold onto as a model of how to become great at something.
## - 🤔 I’m also up for hire for freelancing and consultancy jobs.

### My most proud accomplishment is [ The WORD of GOD:"Risen" ](https://wordofgod.vercel.app/) app that I have created from scrath with create-next-app and added the content, routing and styling of my own.
### I will be re-factoring this project as I go through the curriculum and make the bible I have with the best practices and more modern styling and routing in order to learn and become better at my craft.
### I know that I have something to offer.
## Until then, I am seeking to be successful as a freelancer.

### I earned my Treehouse Frontend Web Development Tech Degree 👨‍💻 in September of 2020 

### I have been doing the best I can to learn and build more with the best technologies around. 

### I've had time to reflect on this wonderfully amazing journey that web development can be and should be, but then again sometimes isn't lol. 

### When I started I was scared to death I would not be able to learn this or that. What I've learned is that it will be harder to get someone to give you a shot TO learn what they need than it will be for you to learn it. 

### So, back at it , building websites for friends and clients alike with higher aspirations for a future and a hope for older developers like me, who got a late start, but are hard at work and already taking their off time to learn new technologies and create beautiful creations with them. 🩹 👼
