## Daily learner, daily contributer, looking to grow & for opportunity!

### I am a Software developer who likes to create and design websites and apps and learn how to improve my abilities therein.
I Have done lots of freelance work & building many ongoing projects for people. 
### My most proud accomplishment is [ The WORD of GOD:"Risen" ](https://the-word-of-god.vercel.app/) app that I have created from scrath with create-next-app
and added the content, routing and styling of my own. I think I have something to offer.
Until then maybe I can become a successful freelancer. 
### God only knows? 
### I earned my Treehouse Frontend Web Development Tech Degree 👨‍💻 in September of 2021 and have been doing the best I can to learn and build more with the best technologies around. I've had time to reflect on this wonderfully amazing journey that web development can be and should be, but then again sometimes isn't lol. When I started I was scared to death I would not be able to learn this or that. What I've learned is that it will be harder to get someone to give you a shot TO learn what they need than it will be for you to learn it. So, back at it , building websites for friends and clients alike with higher aspirations for a future and a hope for older developers like me, who got a late start, but are hard at work and already taking their off time to learn new technologies and create beautiful creations with them. 🩹 👼
## Builder/ Creator 🌱

## The main 3 places I will be posting things about coding, technology, my faith & things of this nature are
## [LinkeIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnuttlovedisciple/),   
## [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jason.nutt.1481/),
## [The WORD of GOD: "Risen"](https://www.youtube.com/@JNUTTLOVEDISCIPLE) 👏 👷‍♂️ All 3 will have different levels of updates and engagement availability as the Bible building experience & community therein grows. Hallelujah! Subscribe to the YouTube channel if you are interested in growing & or supporting the growth of this project and the community of Jesus' disciples around the world. May love and faith be your guide. God bless you all.  
## - 🤯 I'm blown away by the Holy Spirit leading me to build this Bible application with the time He allows after work and on the weekends. Not only does it help me to get better at coding, it also allows me to get a closer relationship with my creator God. I Hope to share the word with as many people around the world as possible. Hope y'all enjoy as I build and flesh this thing out into what it will be. God only knows 👷‍♂️
