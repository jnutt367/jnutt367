## Hi there I'm Jason Nutt 👋  Husband, Father, Doggy Dad 📫 Javascript, React Developer 💻
## MongoDB Student/Developer 👨‍🎓
## Job Seeker /
### Have done lots of freelance work & building many ongoing projects for people. I think I have something to offer. Until then maybe I can become a successful freelancer. God only knows? Been studying and struggling for 3 years now. Took a full time job as a patient service rep at Change health care in the meantime over a year ago now. My few days now with Covid-19 for the first time thank God I've had time to reflect on this wonderfully amazing journey that web development can be and should be and then again sometimes isn't lol ( IF YA KNOW WHAT I MEAN ). When I started I was scared to death I would not be able to learn this or that. What I've learned is that it will be harder to get someone to give you a shot TO learn what they need than it will be for you to learn it. So, back at it , building websites for friends and clients alike with higher aspirations for a future and a hope for older devs like me, who got a late start. 🩹 👼
