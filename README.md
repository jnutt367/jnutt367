## Hi there I'm Jason Nutt 👋
## Husband, Father, Doggy Dad 📫 
## Javascript, React Developer 💻
## MongoDB Student/Developer 👨‍🎓
## Job Seeker / Have done lots of freelance work & building many ongoing projects for people. I think I have something to offer. Until then matbe I can become a successful freelancer. God only knows Been studying and struggling for 3 years now. Took a full time job as a patient service rep at Change health care in the meantime over a year ago now. My few days now with Covid-19 for the first time thank God I've had time to reflect on this wonderfully amazing journey that web development can be and should be and then again sometimes isn't lol ( IF YA KNOW WHAT I MEAN ). When I started I was scared to death I would not be able to learn this or that. What I've learned is that it will be harder to get someone to give you a shot TO learn what they need than it will be for you to learn it. So, back at it , building websites for friends and clients alike with higher aspirations for a future and a hope for older devs like who got a late start. 🩹 👼
## Builder/ Creator 🌱
## Daily Learner  🤔

## The main 3 places I post things about coding and technology and things of this nature.
[LinkeIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnuttlovedisciple/)  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JasonNutt14)  👋 and...the much delayed [A Place for Creating / with Jason Nutt](https://www.youtube.com/user/JNUTT1000) 
# 🔭 ...I've been building a D&D Character examples app(This is a Next.js application that utilizes a MongoDB atlas cluster & MongoDB Realm for it's backend, designed & queried by yours truly) that includes a javascript dice roller and encounter suggestions link. More to come. Building as I grow.
# 🔭 ...And I’m currently working on ...Restarting the #100daysofcode journey with newfound encouragement...
# I will be posting about that in the MongoDB forums as well. [MongoDBCommunity](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/invites/tW7w3BZ6T8)

### Expanding on an E-Commerce site. Adding extra features each iteration. The series I have followed to get this far is the [Jumpstart 2021 series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4RCxklHWZ9v2lcat4oEVGQhZg6r4IQGV) I highly recommend!
